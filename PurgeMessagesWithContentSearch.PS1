# PurgeMessagesWithContentSearch.PS1
# https://github.com/12Knocksinna/Office365itpros/blob/master/PurgeMessagesWithContentSearch.PS1
#
# A script to purge messages from Exchange Online using an Office 365 content search and a purge action applied to 
# the results of that search. Note: This approach only works when there are fewer than 10 items to be removed from mailboxes.
# If more problematic items exist in a mailbox, consider using the Search-Mailbox cmdlet to remove them.

# be used in the search
