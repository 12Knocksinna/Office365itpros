# TeamsGroupsActivityReport.PS1
# A script to check the activity of Microsoft 365 Groups and Teams and report the groups and teams that might be deleted because they're not used.
# We check the group mailbox to see what the last time a conversation item was added to the Inbox folder. 
# Another check sees whether a low number of items exist in the mailbox, which would show that it's not being used.
# We also check the group document library in SharePoint Online to see whether it exists or has been used in the last 90 days.
# And we check Teams compliance items to figure out if any chatting is happening.

# Created 29-July-2016  Tony Redmond 
# V2.0 5-Jan-2018
# V3.0 17-Dec-2018
# V4.0 11-Jan-2020
# V4.1 15-Jan-2020 Better handling of the Team Chat folder
# V4.2 30-Apr-2020 Replaced $G.Alias with $G.ExternalDirectoryObjectId. Fixed problem with getting last conversation from Groups where no conversations are present.
# V4.3 13-May-2020 Fixed bug and removed the need to load the Teams PowerShell module
# V4.4 14-May-2020 Added check to exit script if no Microsoft 365 Groups are found
# V4.5 15-May-2020 Some people reported that Get-Recipient is unreliable when fetching Groups, so added code to revert to Get-UnifiedGroup if nothing is returned by Get-Recipient
# V4.6 8-Sept-2020 Better handling of groups where the SharePoint team site hasn't been created
# V4.7 13-Oct-2020 Teams compliance records are now in a different location in group mailboxes
# V4.8 16-Dec-2020 Some updates after review of code to create 5.0 (Graph based version)
#
