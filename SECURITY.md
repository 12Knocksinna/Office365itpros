# Office365ITPros Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We suggest that you use the current version of PowerShell Core to run the code in the sample scripts. Our policy is to use the latest version of PowerShell Code during development and to run scripts, including Azure Automation runbooks. It is possible that some scripts (like anything using the SharePoint Online management module) will only run on Windows PowerShell 5.1.

| PowerShell Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 7.1+  | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.1  | :white_check_mark::                |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security information shown in scripts like app secrets, X.509 certificate thumbprints, and tenant identifiers are not real and must be replaced with your own values before scripts can run.

If you find something wrong, let us know by sending email to Office365Book at Office365itpros DOT Com
